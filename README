This little program is to help people experiencing video tearing with nVidia proprietary driver.
All it does is it runs one of the three bash scripts provided with the program to switch between compositors (xfwm4, dcompmgr, cairo-compgr).
To run:
python2 <path_to_script>/compSwitcher.py
Make sure that the script is in the same directory as Icons and Scripts folders.
